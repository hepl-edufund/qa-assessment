# EduFund QA Take-home Assessment

## What is to be done

1. Setup JEST and write as many tests as possible (will be tested using `npx jest` and the % Lines indicator there will be used)
2. Manual test our Andorid/iOS app : https://onelink.to/edufund
3. Manual test our web app : https://app.edufund.in/

## How to run this project

This is a simple React application with just the two basic steps (make sure you have Node and NPM/Yarn installed):

```
npm install / yarn install
npm run start / yarn start
```

## Deliverables

* ZIP folder or link to forked repository with the JEST tests integrated. Please remember to add any additional steps that need to be followed after ```npm install / yarn install``` and before ```npx jest```
* Word Doc or PDF with notes from the manual testing on this app, our app and our WebApp
