# EduFund QA Take-home Assessment

## What is to be done

1. Setup JEST or any other testing framework and write as many tests as possible for this sample project. In case of JEST, we will be testing using `npx jest` and the `% Lines indicator` there will be used. In case of a testing framework other than JEST please provide the full steps and tell us how to view the code coverage.
2. Manual test our Andorid/iOS app : https://onelink.to/edufund
3. Manual test our web app : https://app.edufund.in/

## How to run this project

This is a simple React application with just the two basic steps (make sure you have Node and NPM/Yarn installed):

```
npm install / yarn install
npm run start / yarn start
```

## Deliverables

* ZIP folder or link to forked repository with the JEST or other tests integrated. Please remember to document any additional steps that need to be followed. For example, in case you have used JEST, please specify if there are steps required other than just ```npm install / yarn install``` and ```npx jest```. In case of any other testing framework, please provide all the steps required to run the tests.
* Document containing notes from the manual testing on our Mobile app(s) and our WebApp.
